# Classes

## Nameing of classes:
First letter always big. Rest small.

ex. `class Window`

## Nameing of methods:
First letter always big. Rest small. If needed other words also start from big letter.

ex. `void TestMethod()`

## Separation
We do separate classes' methods from classes' fields. First methods later fields.

## Private / public
First publics, later privates.

# Functions
Naming of functions - all letters are small, if needed we use '_' in between of words.

ex. `void test_function()`

# Variables
Variables are written with lowercase letters with '_' in between if needed.
